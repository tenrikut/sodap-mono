- **Visual feedback** with loading spinners and colored status badges

### **Code Quality Improvements**

- **Reusable utility functions** for localStorage management
- **Enhanced error handling** with specific error types
- **Better separation of concerns** with utility functions
- **Type safety** with updated interfaces
- **Event-driven updates** for real-time UI synchronization

## üß™ Testing Status

### **Automated Tests** ‚úÖ

- [x] TypeScript compilation - PASSED
- [x] Production build - PASSED
- [x] No compilation errors - VERIFIED

### **Manual Testing Recommendations** üìã

1. **Transaction Flow Testing**

   - [ ] Test normal refund flow (Pending ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Approved)
   - [ ] Test failed transaction handling (Processing ‚Üí Pending)
   - [ ] Test timeout scenarios with explorer links

2. **UI/UX Testing**

   - [ ] Verify Processing status displays correctly with spinner
   - [ ] Test automatic status checking (wait 30+ seconds)
   - [ ] Test manual "Check Processing" button
   - [ ] Verify Solana Explorer links work correctly

3. **Error Handling Testing**

   - [ ] Test insufficient funds scenario
   - [ ] Test user rejection handling
   - [ ] Test network connectivity issues
   - [ ] Test transaction expiry scenarios

4. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Verify 45-second timeout works correctly
   - [ ] Test 1.5-second polling responsiveness
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage with automatic checking
